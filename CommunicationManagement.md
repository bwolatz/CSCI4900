## Communication Management

Brian and Nikhit will primarily communicate through emails and in-person during class. They will open issues in GitHub for all problems, even if the issue creator plans on solving the issue himself, as it is important to keep the other team member up-to-date on the progress of the project. It is essential that this communication plan is employed, for it will keep all relevant project work documented and the other mediums of communicated will be either in-person or over email, both of which are very effective.
