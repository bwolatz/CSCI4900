Grade me specifically on: The functional code in main.py (not the defintion things). If you're grading the SHA-256 on this assignment as well I did that

My experiences: I don't know anything about maven or python so it's always a 20 tab chrome session of stack overflow whenever I want to get something done. I also experienced a hefty amount of problems with dosocs which kept initial development at bay.
