## Communication Management

Brian and Nikhit will primarily communicate through emails and in-person during class. They will open issues in GitHub for all problems, even if the issue creator plans on solving the issue himself, as it is important to keep the other team member up-to-date on the progress of the project. It is essential that this communication plan is employed, for it will keep all relevant project work documented and the other mediums of communicated will be either in-person or over email, both of which are very effective. Technical Issues with the project should be handled by submitting GitHub issues, other issues should be solved using email and in-person communication.

In review of this communication plan, there does appear to be a few flaws. First, it is not easy to request simple resources from one another as we do not have a dedicated email chain for that nor are the requested items necessary to submit a whole issue over. To combat this, we have opened an email chain dedicated to asking each other questions and for resources.
